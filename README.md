# KPI Analysis using Power BI
This project aims to create a Key Performance Indicators (KPI) Dashboard, which contains a set of agreed-upon quantitative measurements for evaluating a sales organization's performance. Sales representatives, managers, and executives use KPIs to measure progress toward goals, spot high-level patterns and themes, and manage individual and team performance.
